In this patch, there is only one object of interest: the `led` node, a grey rectangle with little circles. You will be able to make complicated programs using this rectangles. \n\nFirst, try to move the rectangle. Its position on the workspace does not affect your program but can make it more readable. \n\n## Instructions\n\n1. On the left-hand side, you will find a list of patches grouped by a project or library name. The list is called a *Project Browser*. The first item in it is `welcome-to-xod`. This is a special tutorial project you’re working with right now. Expand the project by clicking on it.\n\n2. As you can see, the tutorial consists of many patches. Right now, we are in patch `01-hello`. The next part of the tutorial is in patch `02-deploy`. Double-click it, and let's meet there!\n\nIf anything goes wrong or you have no idea what to do, we have [hints for every patch](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/01-hello/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial_01) on the web.",

The browser version does not have permission to access the USB ports. Although you’re still able to upload XOD programs even from the browser version if you have the original Arduino IDE installed ([learn how](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/02-deploy/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial_02)).\n\nIf you did it the right way, you will see the LED turn on.

Pins are divided into inputs and outputs. Inputs are always on the top side of the nodes, outputs on the bottom.\n\nThe `led` node is a simple LED-controlling node. It can control only one single-colored LED. The node has input pins `PORT` and `LUM` along with a few other pins you can ignore for now.\n\nPins are used to transfer data between nodes. Nodes process these values and take some action or give a result. In our case, the `led` node transfers the led brightnes value (set in `LUM`) to the Arduino port (set in `PORT`).\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Click on the `led` node. You will see the Inspector under the list of projects. You can set the node parameters in the Inspector.\n\n2. In the Inspector, change the `LUM` value from 1 to 0.\n\n3. Upload the program to the Arduino. To do so, select Deploy → Upload to Arduino from the menu.\n\nThe LED will switch off after the upload because Arduino sent a value of 0 to the LED's pin.

All you need to do is to replace the `constant-number` node with a `pot` node and transfer the brightness value to LED1 and LED2 from this pot node, instead of the `constant-number`.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Delete the links between the pins. To do this, click on a link, then press Delete or Backspace key.\n\n2. Delete the `constant-number` node. Click on it and press Delete or Backspace.\n\n3. Find the `pot` node in the Project Browser inside the `xod/common-hardware` library.\n\n4. Connect a potentiometer to the Arduino according to the [scheme](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/09-pot/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial_09).\n\n5. Set the `PORT` pin value on the `pot` node to A0, bacause it’s connected to analog Arduino port A0. \n\n6. Link the `pot` node `VAL` pin to the `LUM` pins on the LED1 and LED2 nodes.\n\n7. Upload the patch to the Arduino.\n\nIf you turn the potentiometer knob, it will affect the brightness of the LEDs. Depending on the angle of the knob, the `pot` node returns a value from 0.0 to 1.0 to the `VAL` pin, and that value is transferred to the `LUM` pins of both LED nodes.",

The output value which is\na servo angle will fall outside the desired range too.\n\nFor such cases there is a sibling node called `map-clip`. It works the\nsame way, but any input that is out of range will be rounded to `Smin` or\n`Smax`.  Thus, if `X` receives a value of 10, the `map-clip` node will accept it as 15, and 42 will be accepted as 30.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Replace the `map` node with a `map-clip` node. They both are located in `xod/math`.\n\n2. Set the input range (`Smin` and `Smax`) to 15–30.\n\n3. Set the output range (`Tmin` and `Tmax`) to 0–0.5.\n\n4. (Optional) If you prefer °F, you can easily translate the data from the thermometer with the `c-to-f` node from `xod/units`. The range will be 59–95°F.\n\n5. Upload.\n\nNow the servo is more sensitive to the changes of the temperature sensor.",

Link the `VAL` pins of the `constant-string` nodes to the `L1` and `L2` inputs on the screen node. `L1` and `L2` stand for the first and second line of the screen\n3.

Assemble the [circuit with a thermometer, photoresistor, and LCD](https://xod.io/docs/tutorial/28-string-concat/?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide_comment&utm_campaign=tutorial_28).\n2. Find the `constant-string` node in the library. Add one above each `concat`.\n3. Assign string values to each node using the Inspector. Try something like “Temp: ” and “Light: ” to keep things short. Put a space at the end so that when we combine it with another string they won't bunch up.\n4. Link the `VAL` pins of the `constant-string` nodes to the left pins of the `concat` nodes. The left input is the beginning of the line, it’s the first part.\n5. Link the outputs of the thermometer and photoresistor to the right pins on the `concat` nodes. They will be the second part of the generated string.\n6. Upload the patch to the Arduino.\n\nNow, the readings from your sensors are displayed on the screen with a convenient label!\n\n## Try it yourself\n\nTry to display the measurement label before the reading and the units of measurement afterward. Use two more `concat` nodes for this. But remember, you only have 16 characters per line.\n\nTry to convert degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit and label them accordingly. You will find a clue for this task in patch 14.\n",
