## Bug Report or Tweak Template <!-- Delete the header -->

### Environment

- Scope: desktop IDE, browser IDE, CLI
- Version: 0.xx.x | dev <!-- Hit “Help” in the IDE main menu to view -->
- OS: Windows 10 | macOS High Sierra (10.13) | Ubuntu 18.04
- Machine: i3, 4 GB RAM

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open this
2. Press that
3. Click here and there

If the test program is not trivial, attach its `.xodball`. You’ll have to zip
the file as GitHub does not accept file attachments with custom extensions.

### Expected behavior

What should happen?

### Actual behavior

What’s happen now?

If it will make the issue more illustrative, attach screenshots or GIF’s of
what’s going on.

### Console output <!-- if any -->

Are there any errors in the console? Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open the developer
tools and find the “Console” tab there. Error are shown in red. Expand an
error, then copy and paste the output verbatim.  Use fenced code blocks (triple
backticks) to preserve formatting.

### How to fix <!-- if you know -->

If you have an idea on how the bug can be fixed, provide a short
description.



## Refactoring Template <!-- Delete the header -->

### Rationale

Why should we refactor? Will it make the code more DRY, KISS, YAGNI?

### Affected modules and packages

Provide a description of scope the refactoring would touch.

Which backward compatibility would be dropped.



## Feature/Story Template <!-- Delete the header -->

### Rationale

What we have now, what we want then? How the implementation would
make the product better for end-users?

### Prerequisites

Refer to issues by their #numbers that should be completed before
the development of this issue would make sense

### Acceptance criteria

Provide some steps that an end-user would be able to perform when
the feature could be considered as implemented. E.g.:

- [ ] I can click a new Boo menu item
- [ ] A dialog appears where I can enter Foo value
- [ ] Clicking OK changes all nodes’ labels to the Foo value

### Out of scope

Explicitly list functionality that is not intended to be done with this story.

### How to implement

If you have an idea on how to implement it, provide a short
description.

### How to test

How can we test what’s implemented?
