# XOD

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/xodio/xod/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/xodio/xod/tree/master)

XOD is a visual programming language for microcontrollers. This repository contains sources for the XOD language core, XOD IDE, and XOD standard library.

## Installation & Quick start

Download the latest IDE version for desktop or run the browser-based IDE at <https://xod.io>.

Documentation and tutorials are at <https://xod.io/docs/>.

## Building from source

XOD is written in JavaScript and ReasonML. You need Node.js and Yarn to build from the source. Make sure they are available on your system.

Clone the repository and set the working directory to its root. Then run:

```bash
# Install all JavaScript and ReasonML dependencies
yarn

# Build all packages of XOD
yarn build
```

To start the desktop IDE run:

```bash
yarn start: electron
```

Alternatively, run browser-based IDE:

```bash
yarn dev: browser
# IDE is available at <http://localhost:8080>
```

## Directory structure

The project is managed as a [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) monorepo and split up into few directories:

* `packages/` — most of the source code is here; navigate to a particular package to see it’s own `README` and get an idea what it is for
* `tools/` — utility scripts to assist build process and routine maintenance tasks
* `workspace/` — XOD standard library, default projects, and end-to-end fixtures

## Repository commands

You can run several commands on source files. They are available as yarn subcommands:

* `yarn build` — build, transpile, pack all
* `yarn build: electron` — build desktop IDE only
* `yarn build:cli` — build CLI tools only
* `yarn dev: browser` — run dev-version of browser IDE on localhost
* `yarn dist: electron` — build OS-specific distributive of desktop IDE
* `yarn test` — run unit tests
* `yarn test-cpp` — run C++ code tests
* `yarn test-func` — run functional tests
* `yarn tabtest` — run standard library tabular tests
* `yarn lint` — run the linter to check code style
* `yarn verify` — build, lint, test; run this before a pull request
* `yarn start:electron` — starts desktop IDE
* `yarn start:spectron-repl` — starts functional tests environment
* `yarn storybook` — starts to React components viewer for visual inspection
* `yarn clean` — remove build artifacts and installed `node_modules`

Note that dependencies between tasks are not resolved. `test` and `start:*` expect that the project is already built.

### Scoping

Many commands (notably `build`, `dev`, `test`) support package scoping to save development time. To rebuild only `xod-project`:

```bash
yarn build --scope xod-project
```

To rebuild `xod-project` and its dependencies:

```bash
yarn build --scope xod-project --include-filtered-dependencies
```

Those are standard [Lerna flags](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#flags).

### Debugging functional tests

`yarn test-func` runs automated end-to-end functional tests.

You can set `XOD_DEBUG_TESTS` environment variable to keep IDE open on failure: `XOD_DEBUG_TESTS=1 yarn test-func`

Use `yarn start:spectron-repl` to run an interactive session and control the IDE window programmatically.

### Running C++ and tabular tests

You need `gcc` and `avr-gcc` to be installed system-wide to run C++ code tests. They are available as OS packages for most platforms.
