XOD is a visual programming language for microcontrollers. For documentation
and downloads visit https://xod.io.

This repository contains sources for XOD language core, XOD IDE, XOD standard
library, and XOD documentation.

Development copy setup
----------------------

We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) to run routine tasks on source
files.  Make sure it is available on your system.  Clone the repository and set
working directory to its root. Then run

    $ yarn

to install all JS dependencies.

### Browser IDE

    $ yarn dev:browser

Open <http://localhost:8080> in your browser.

### Desktop IDE

    $ yarn build:electron
    $ yarn start:electron

Directory structure
-------------------

The project is managed as a [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) monorepo and
split up in few directories:

- `packages/` — most of source code is here; navigate to a particular package
  to see it’s own `README` and get an idea what it is for
- `tools/` — utility scripts to assist build process and routine maintenance
  tasks
- `docs/` — documentation source for https://xod.io/docs/
- `workspace/` — XOD standard library, default projects, and end-to-end
  fixtures

Repository commands
-------------------

You can run several commands on source files. They are available as yarn
subcommands:

- `yarn build` — build, transpile, pack all
- `yarn build:electron` — build desktop IDE only
- `yarn build:cli` — build CLI tools only
- `yarn dev:browser` — run dev-version of browser IDE on localhost
- `yarn dist:electron` — build OS-specific distributive of desktop IDE
- `yarn test` — run unit tests
- `yarn test-cpp` — run C++ code tests
- `yarn test-func` — run functional tests
- `yarn lint` — run the linter to check code style
- `yarn flow` — perform static type checking with Flow
- `yarn verify` — build, lint, typecheck, test; run this prior to a pull request
- `yarn ci` — install & verify; CI-server uses this command
- `yarn start:electron` — starts desktop IDE
- `yarn start:spectron-repl` — starts functional tests environment
- `yarn storybook` — starts React components viewer for visual inspection
- `yarn clean` — remove build artifacts and installed `node_modules`

Note that dependencies between tasks are not resolved. `test` and `start:*`
expect that the project is already built.

### Scoping

Many commands (notably `build`, `dev`, `test`) support package scoping to
save development time. To rebuild only `xod-project`:

    $ yarn build --scope xod-project

To rebuild `xod-project` and its dependencies:

    $ yarn build --scope xod-project --include-filtered-dependencies

Those are standard [Lerna flags](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#flags).

### Debugging functional tests

`yarn test-func` runs automated end-to-end functional tests.

You can set `XOD_DEBUG_TESTS` environment variable to keep IDE open on failure:
`XOD_DEBUG_TESTS=1 yarn test-func`

Use `yarn start:spectron-repl` to run an interactive session and control the
IDE window programmatically.

### Running C++ tests

You need `avr-gcc` and [PlatformIO Core](http://platformio.org/get-started/cli)
to be installed system-wide to run C++ code tests. They are available as OS
packages for most platforms.
