# Contributing to XOD

XOD is open-source software. We appreciate any help to make the project better.
You can contribute in many ways and even without writing a single line of code.
The opportunities are summarized below.

## Thumbs up

Show your attitude to planned changes, feature requests, ideas, and critics with
a single click. Explore [issues](https://github.com/xodio/xod/issues) in the
GitHub repo and [posts on the XOD forum](https://forum.xod.io), add üëçüëé‚ù§Ô∏è as
you go to let us know a topic is significant. Don‚Äôt be shy to use negative
reactions: they help to make correct decisions. If we see a proposal is
important to the community, we can raise its priority and deliver it quicker.

Love powers XOD team. So, if you want to give us a bit of motivation, star the
[XOD repository](https://github.com/xodio/xod) on GitHub.

## Talk on the forum

[XOD forum](https://forum.xod.io) is the central place where newcomers ask for
assistance, and mature xoders come with feature requests and other proposals. Be
a part of the discussion. The more xoders share their experience and thoughts,
the better product we can make.

## Report bugs

If some behavior is definitely a bug and not a feature, help to hunt it down by
reporting the exact steps so that anyone can reproduce the problem.

You may report the bug on the forum or as a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/xodio/xod/issues/new). The later is much more
preferable since the issues on GitHub _are_ the tasks for core developers and
forum posts are yet to be converted into issues. By making the report directly
on GitHub you save our time, and we can fix the problem quicker.

Use the
[template](https://github.com/xodio/xod/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
which you see when you‚Äôre filing an issue to provide as many details as
possible. Also, try to narrow down your scenario to a minimal working/failing
example. That is if you have got a big project causing a problem, start with
deleting parts not relevant to the issue and observing the result: is the
problem still there? Repeat until you will get the most straightforward sequence
of steps to reproduce the problem without any noise surrounding it.

## Fix the grammar

XOD core developers are not native English speakers. So, we commit grammar
mistakes, typos, and poor wording. Hey, grammar nazi, help XOD to fulfill your
expectations.

Phrases you see in the XOD IDE are embedded somewhere in the XOD source code
which is open and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/xodio/xod). You can
edit a file and send us a pull request right within GitHub web interface without
installing anything:

* Enter the term you would like to change in the
  [GitHub repository search](https://github.com/xodio/xod/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=typozz&type=)
  to find and open a file with the mistake.
* [Edit, commit, pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/).

If you‚Äôd like to review a bunch of UI phrases at once, many of them are spread
over
[`message.js` files](https://github.com/xodio/xod/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=filename%3Amessages.js&type=).
Fill free to edit.

When a mistake is on a documentation page the way to edit is the same. And as a
convenience feature, you can click the ‚ÄúEdit this page‚Äù button located on the
top of any page to jump directly into the required source file.

## Blog and share

The bigger the community, the more vibrant XOD ecosystem.

Do your friends and colleagues know about XOD? A short note or repost on
Twitter, blog, or another medium will help to spread the word and give the
language a stronger foundation.

If you have completed some device, project, video, or article using XOD, wow!
Promptly share it on the forum in
[Look what I‚Äôve done](https://forum.xod.io/c/look-what-i-ve-done) category. We
share the interesting parts further.

Offline events is another cup of tea. Would you like to speak at a conference,
meet-up, or a workshop? Tell us if we can support you anyhow with hardware or
media: write a message on [hello@xod.io](mailto:hello@xod.io).

## Make libraries

If you‚Äôve spent some time tinkering with XOD, the chances you‚Äôve done something
useful are high. Don‚Äôt hesitate to
[extract useful nodes into a library](/docs/guide/#making-your-own-nodes) and
[publish it on the cloud](/docs/guide/creating-libraries/) so that other could
base their projects on your work.

Don‚Äôt forget to share your cake on the forum in
[Look what I‚Äôve done](https://forum.xod.io/c/look-what-i-ve-done) category.

## Improve the docs

If you fill the documentation is incomplete, unclear, or even misguiding at some
points, help XOD to improve it. Add sections, rewrite paragraphs, provide
examples, enhance style as you wish and send us a pull request. The process is
the same as for [fixing the grammar](#fix-the-grammar).

## Translate the docs

Not everyone is comfortable with English. You‚Äôd help international users if
provide translated versions for documentation articles.

Any original article is contained in a `README.md` file somewhere under the
[`/docs/` directory](https://github.com/xodio/xod/tree/master/docs) in the
repository. To provide a translation, create a new file next to the `README.md`
with the name reflecting the target language (`DE.md`, `IT.md`, `PT.md`,
`FR.md`, `ES.md`, `RU.md`, `JA.md`, `KO.md`, `CN.md`) and send us a pull
request.

## Contribute to code

If you fill the power, you may try contributing to the core code. Follow the
guidelines described in the
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/xodio/xod/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in
the GitHub repo and choose one of the issues to work one.

The best candidates to start with are:

* [Issues tagged with ‚Äúhelp wanted‚Äù](https://github.com/xodio/xod/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
* [Tweaks](https://github.com/xodio/xod/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3At%3Atweak)
* [Bugs](https://github.com/xodio/xod/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3At%3Abug)

Post a comment to an issue thread if you would like to take on it. We can
provide more details and respond to technical questions. Others will see the
traction.
