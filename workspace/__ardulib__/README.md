Arduino libraries
=================

The directory contains vendoring copies of some Arduino Libraries used in
native nodes’ implementations.

* `LiquidCrystal` -- the standard library
* `LiquidCrystal_I2C` -- https://github.com/fdebrabander/Arduino-LiquidCrystal-I2C-library
* `SD` -- the standard library
* `Servo` -- the standard library
* `Ethernet2` -- https://github.com/xodio/Ethernet2 (modified  https://github.com/adafruit/Ethernet2)
* `ESP8266UART` -- custom library. Should be published to the XOD GitHub repository
                   along with the "UART" library, which is bundled into `xod-arduino/platform`
                   and some `xod/uart` nodes.
